            <li>Sitting Bull had a strong, stern face with prominent cheekbones and deep-set eyes. His face often bore a solemn, contemplative expression, reflecting his role as a wise leader and strategist. His long, dark hair was typically braided and adorned with feathers and beads, traditional to the Lakota Sioux culture. He was of average height for his time and had a robust, muscular build, indicating his active lifestyle as a warrior and leader. He often wore traditional Lakota clothing, which included fringed buckskin shirts, leggings, and moccasins. His attire was frequently decorated with intricate beadwork and quillwork, showcasing the artistry of his people. Sitting Bull was known to wear a single eagle feather in his hair, signifying his status and achievements. He also wore a necklace made of bones and animal teeth, symbolizing his prowess as a hunter and warrior.</li></br>
            <li>Sitting Bull was a prominent Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux holy man and tribal chief, revered for his leadership, wisdom, and resistance against U.S. government policies. He is best known for his role in the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, where the combined forces of the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes defeated General George Custerâ€™s 7th Cavalry. Sitting Bull was known for his steadfastness, bravery, and deep commitment to the preservation of his people's way of life. He was also a spiritual leader, known for his visions that guided his decisions and actions.</li></br>
            <li>Sitting Bull played a pivotal role in the coalition of Native American tribes that decisively defeated General George Custer and his 7th Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. His leadership and spiritual guidance were crucial in rallying the Lakota Sioux, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors to resist U.S. military efforts to force them onto reservations.</li></br>
            <li>Throughout his life, Sitting Bull staunchly opposed U.S. government policies that aimed to dispossess Native Americans of their lands and assimilate them into American culture. He resisted signing treaties that he believed would undermine the sovereignty and way of life of his people. His defiance and commitment to preserving his people's traditions and territories made him a symbol of Native American resistance.</li></br>
            <li>Sitting Bull was not only a political and military leader but also a revered spiritual leader (a Wicasa Wakan). His visions, particularly the one he had before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, were believed to be prophetic and played a significant role in motivating and uniting his people. His spiritual influence extended beyond his lifetime, contributing to his lasting legacy as a cultural and spiritual icon among Native Americans.</li></br>
